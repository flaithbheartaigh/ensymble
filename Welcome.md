# Welcome #

This is the Ensymble developer utilities for [Symbian OS™](http://www.symbian.com/), a collection of [Python®](http://www.python.org/) modules and command line programs for Symbian OS software development.

Current focus of Ensymble development is to provide useful tools for making [Python for S60](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60) programs. Supported functions include generation of SIS (installation) packages, merging several SIS packages into one, (re-)signing existing SIS packages and modifying extension DLL headers. Support for other Symbian OS software development tasks will follow.

A long term goal of Ensymble is to provide a cross-platform, open-source way to do Symbian OS software development, supporting Symbian OS versions 9.1 and later. The original tools by Symbian are closed source and only available for the Windows® operating system. Ensymble is under the GNU [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) license.


# Requirements #

  * Operating system:
    * Most Unix-like operating systems, tested on Linux and OS X
    * Windows® NT, 2000 or XP, tested on XP
  * Python v2.2 or greater, tested on Python v2.2, v2.3, v2.4 and v2.5
  * The [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) command line tool:
    * OpenSSL is pre-installed on most Linux systems and on OS X.
    * For Windows, the [Stunnel OpenSSL binaries](http://www.stunnel.org/download/binaries.html) are recommended.

Ensymble targets Symbian OS v9.1 and later. For Nokia phones, this means S60 3rd Edition. 1st and 2nd Edition phones are not directly supported by Ensymble. A list of editions for Nokia phones is available from [Forum Nokia](http://www.forum.nokia.com/devices/matrix_s60_1.html). (See [py2sisng](http://py2sisng.googlecode.com/) for a cross-platform version of py2sis, compatible with S60 1st and 2nd Edition.)

The py2sis command of Ensymble produces installation packages (SIS) for [Python for S60](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60) version 1.4.0 and later. Version 1.4.0 of Python for S60 is the first officially signed release from Nokia. Although packages generated with Ensymble also work with PyS60 from v1.3.8 upto v1.3.23, a harmless warning is generated during installation for a missing Python for S60 component.

NOTE: PyS60 versions 1.3.20 and older require that SIS files generated by Ensymble are installed into main phone memory instead of memory card. This [bug](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1579521&group_id=154155&atid=790646) has been corrected in version 1.3.21 of PyS60.


# Download #

Ensymble is now (since 2010-05-18) packaged using python's standard distutils package. Here's the [latest version](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/ensymble-0.28.tar.gz)

Releases of Ensymble prior to v0.28 are in the form of pre-[squeezed](http://effbot.org/zone/squeeze.htm) binaries and are ready to use. Just copy the file to a suitable place (on command search path) and start using it! They are available from the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/ensymble/downloads/list) section of this project.


## Latest ##
v0.29 2010-05-18
  * Source: [ensymble-0.29.tar.gz](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/ensymble-0.28.tar.gz) (73.9 kB)

v0.28 2009-01-30

  * Source: [ensymble-0.28.tar.gz](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/ensymble-0.28.tar.gz) (99 kB)
  * Pre-squeezed version for Python v2.2 no longer available.
  * Pre-squeezed version for Python v2.3: [ensymble\_python2.3-0.28.py](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/ensymble_python2.3-0.28.py) (85 kB)
  * Pre-squeezed version for Python v2.4: [ensymble\_python2.4-0.28.py](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/ensymble_python2.4-0.28.py) (82 kB)
  * Pre-squeezed version for Python v2.5: [ensymble\_python2.5-0.28.py](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/ensymble_python2.5-0.28.py) (80 kB)
  * Documentation: [README-0.28.txt](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/files/README-0.28.txt) (44 kB)

Changes:

  * Added genuid command for generating test-range UIDs.
  * Added --unsign option to the signsis command. This is useful when submitting the SIS file to an external signing authority, otherwise the Ensymble default certificate may remain in the resulting signed SIS file.
  * Corrected a bug where DLLs (PYDs) would fail with the py2sis --extrasdir option. Previously trying to add PYDs or DLLs using --extrasdir would cause the installation to fail.
  * Corrected an encoding bug in simplesis automatic UID generation.
  * Corrected a possible Unicode exception in py2sis automatic UID generation.
  * Added a warning about using a test-range UID that's different from Ensymble-generated one.
